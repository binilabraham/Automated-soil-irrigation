Current Sensor used is an non-inavsion Current sensor of 10A

Its actually a Current Transformer which can cliped to the exterior of the incoming power line and we can measure the power utilised 
in the power line. With the inputs from the current values we can measure the load as there is not much difference in the volatge.

This current Sensor needs to be connected to the ciruit as per the wiring diagram inorder to reduce input voltage to the Arduino from
the secondary of the CT. Here I measured both input and ground values to make the calculations more acccurate.

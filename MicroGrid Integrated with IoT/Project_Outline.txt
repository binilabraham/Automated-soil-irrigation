# Microgrid 
A microgrid is a local energy grid with control capability, which means it can
disconnect from the utility grid and operate autonomously known as islanding. It
can also be defined as an interconnection of distributed energy sources and loads
with a clearly defined electrical boundaries. The grid connects homes, businesses
and other buildings to central power sources, which allow us to use appliances,
heating/cooling systems and electronics. A microgrid can be powered by
renewable resources like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and/or distributed
generators. Depending on how itâ€™s fueled and how its requirements are managed, a
microgrid might run indefinitely. A microgrid not only provides backup for the
grid in case of emergencies, but can also be used to cut costs, or connect to a local
resource that is too small or unreliable for traditional grid use. A microgrid allows
communities to be more energy independent, resilient and reliable, in some cases,
more environmentally friendly.
In order to monitor and optimize energy consumption the microgrid is
integrated with I.o.T. Internet of things (I.o.T) can be defined as any device that is
embedded with sensor/electronics which is connected to internet and can be
remotely controlled.
